This morning I had to take care of several things, from resolving personal issues to renewing my ID card, and even working outside of home. Unfortunately,
it seems that I couldn't dedicate this morning to the Python studying project.

I just arrived home and now I have to cook, eat, do laundry, hang it to dry, take a shower, and go out again, so we could say that today has been a "Lost Day..."
