I don't have special knowledge in accounting or Excel/Google Sheets type tables,
but I've always thought that I can learn anything I set my mind to,
so I spent 2-3 hours making some simple tables that a chum asked me for his job.

This is what I managed to do after getting a clearer idea of what my chum wanted and doing some research online about the formulas and all that:

It's not very sophisticated, and it may potentially have issues in the future (although I haven't encountered any so far after some testing and verification),
but I think it's quite good considering I only spent a couple of hours, or maybe a bit more, working on it and started with no knowledge at all.

So, my study hours this morning were dedicated to working on this; and then I had to go out for some shopping, so I didn't have much time for anything else.
It's true that I could have maybe spent half an hour coding when I came back, but I slept so poorly last night that I decided to take a "day off" today.
