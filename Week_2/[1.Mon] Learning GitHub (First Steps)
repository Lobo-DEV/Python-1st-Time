1. I educated myself a bit about the basics of GitHub.

2. I created my first "Repository", called: "Python-1st-Time".
2a. I did some testing uploading files and trying to create "Folders" within my Repository, but it took me longer than I thought to figure out how to do it.

3. I created my first "Project", called: "Python First Time In My Life".
3a. I tried adding my "Python-1st-Time" Repository to the "Python First Time In My Life" Project, intending to have a more visual way to see my progress, but eventually found that the "Projects" are not what I thought and that something like this could not be done (At least I think so at the moment...).
3b. I deleted the Project called: "Python First Time In My Life".

4. I imagine that all of this will seem obvious and simple to anyone who is used to using GitHub, but for me, each small step has taken me longer than I wanted. I must continue learning to use this tool, because I understand that it is useful, the useless one is me XD (For now... ¬¬')
